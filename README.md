# Brain Fucking BrainFuck  

So, one day, I found a tutorial about brainfuck. ([The tutorial](https://gist.github.com/roachhd/dce54bec8ba55fb17d3a))  

This is the repository created after reading that tutorial. That's all.  

To be honest, it's interesting.  

The example in this repository is a simple brainfuck code that prints **0penth3wind0w**.
